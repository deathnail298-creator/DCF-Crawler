# 06 — License & Execution Guardrails

## Purpose

Phase 2 is **thinking space**.

This document exists to clearly define:
- what you are allowed to do with Phase 2 material
- what you are not allowed to do
- where execution lives
- how rights, responsibilities, and boundaries are controlled

The point is not legal intimidation.
The point is to keep Phase 2 honest, disciplined, and non-abusive.

---

## Core Principle

Phase 2 exists to enable:

- reading
- analysis
- planning
- critique
- structured reasoning
- intelligent forward thinking

Phase 2 does **not** exist to authorize:
- building
- prototyping
- fielding
- commercialization
- derivative operational deployments

Thinking is free.  
Execution is not.

---

## Allowed Uses (No Permission Required)

You may, without asking:

- read this material
- study it internally
- include it in planning discussions
- evaluate mission fit
- critique it
- use it in academic / research reasoning contexts
- reference it in presentations as a **concept**

You may treat Phase 2 like a detailed architectural whitepaper.

No fees.
No licensing burden.
No drama.

---

## Explicitly Prohibited Uses (Without Execution License)

You may **NOT**:

- fabricate a DCF unit
- prototype a DCF unit
- field test a DCF unit
- deploy a DCF unit in any environment
- operationalize any component derived from Phase 2
- incorporate DCF concepts into live mission logistics
- commercialize derivative implementations
- treat Phase 2 as an “implied approval”

You may not convert Phase 2 theory into a real-world object or operational program
without formal execution rights.

---

## Derivative Restriction

You may **NOT**:

- create derivatives intended for execution
- re-brand the same concept for live deployment
- implement functionally equivalent systems to bypass licensing
- take the concept commercial under a different name
- execute “inspired” but materially equivalent deployments

This protects:
- the integrity of the work
- the structure of Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 discipline
- the right to control execution maturity

If you want to build, test, deploy, or operationalize,
Phase 3 is where that conversation happens.

---

## Execution Lives in Phase 3

Phase 3 is the only domain where:

- execution planning
- operational doctrine
- deployment authorization
- field integration governance
- licensing to build and operate

are defined and allowed.

Phase 3 includes:
- execution license
- legal grounding
- operational rules
- governance and ownership structure

If you reach the point where you want this to exist physically,
Phase 3 is the correct and only path.

---

## Why This Boundary Exists

The boundary prevents:

- premature real-world implementation
- hype-driven fielding
- uncontrolled derivative proliferation
- organizations quietly “borrowing and deploying”
- operational risk emerging from half-understood thinking
- lawyers showing up later

It preserves:
- clarity
- discipline
- safety
- trust
- structured maturation

This keeps the ecosystem clean.

---

## Enforcement Position

This is plain:

If you want to execute,
ask.

Phase 3 exists for a reason.

Phase 2 is not:
- a loophole
- a grey zone
- implied permission
- “good enough justification”
- a backdoor to deployment

Phase 2 is thoughtspace.
Phase 3 is actionspace.

They are intentionally different.

---

## Cultural Guardrail

Phase 2 should not attract:
- hype merchants
- “innovation theater”
- resume-builders looking for cool hardware credit
- opportunists trying to bypass cost or governance

Phase 2 is where grown-ups sit quietly, think clearly,
and decide rationally whether execution is worth doing.

If Phase 2 makes execution look automatic or inevitable,
Phase 2 has failed.

---

## Summary Boundary Statement

You may:
- Think.
- Study.
- Plan.
- Analyze.
- Debate.
- Prepare.

You may not:
- Build.
- Test.
- Deploy.
- Operationalize.
- Commercialize.
- Execute derivatives.

Execution requires Phase 3
and an execution license.

That is the guardrail.
