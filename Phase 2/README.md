# Phase 2 — System Architecture Theory

## Purpose

Phase 2 exists to enable serious engineers, mission planners, and reviewers to reason forward about the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) in a disciplined, structured way — **without authorizing execution or operational deployment**.

This phase is deliberately framed as **theory-only**:
- No manufacturing authorization
- No field testing authorization
- No deployment authorization
- No implied guarantees

Thinking is free. Execution is not.

## What Phase 2 Provides

Phase 2 documents create clarity around:

- How a mature DCF ecosystem could function
- Where it logically fits into lunar surface operations
- Reliability expectations and graceful degradation behavior
- Risks and mitigation logic
- Decision-support clarity for stakeholders evaluating Phase 3

The purpose is not to convince.  
The purpose is to make decisions easier, grounded, and honest.

## What Phase 2 Does NOT Do

Phase 2 does **not**:
- Approve building hardware
- Approve prototypes
- Approve field experimentation
- Approve operational deployment

If you want to execute, that is **Phase 3**, governed by an execution license.

## Phase 2 Documents

- 01 — System Architecture Theory  
- 02 — Integration Plan: Operations & Logistics  
- 03 — Reliability & Graceful Degradation Model  
- 04 — Risk Register & Mitigation Paths  
- 05 — Phase 2 Success Criteria  
- 06 — License & Execution Guardrails

## Phase Philosophy

The DCF is intentionally:
- Passive
- Dumb
- Non-heroic
- Failure-tolerant
- Infrastructure, not a gadget

If Phase 2 successfully produces rational clarity and disciplined reasoning paths, it has succeeded.

If Phase 2 turns into hype, promises, or fantasy engineering, it has failed.

## License & Execution Boundary

Phase 2 material is protected under a theory-only license.

You may:
- Read
- Study
- Analyze
- Discuss
- Use internally for planning

You may NOT:
- Build
- Deploy
- Prototype
- Operationalize
- Derive and execute competing systems

Execution requires Phase 3 authorization.
