# Phase 3 Execution Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist exists to ensure that execution of the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) is:

- authorized
- disciplined
- safe
- governed
- sane

If a box cannot be checked honestly,
execution is not ready.

This is not paperwork.
This is responsibility.

---

## Section 1 — Readiness to Execute

### Ownership & Governance
[ ] Ownership assigned to **Surface Infrastructure / Site Operations**  
[ ] Execution Governance acknowledged and accepted  
[ ] Risk Posture & Failure Doctrine accepted  
[ ] Removal / retirement authority explicitly defined  
[ ] Phase 3 execution license approved  

If any of these are “no,” execution stops.

---

## Section 2 — Site Readiness

### Operational Fit
[ ] Deployment location selected intentionally  
[ ] Location aligns with perimeter / corridor doctrine  
[ ] Safety risk reviewed  
[ ] EVA traffic impact acceptable  
[ ] Rover routing impact acceptable  
[ ] Emergency routing impact acceptable  

### Cultural Fit
[ ] No leadership discomfort  
[ ] No “prestige pressure” attached  
[ ] Crew tolerance confidence exists  

If deployment requires anxiety, do not deploy.

---

## Section 3 — Deployment Execution

### Deployment Discipline
[ ] Conservative initial deployment scale  
[ ] Avoided high-interference locations  
[ ] Clear placement justification (simple, not theatrical)  
[ ] Basic positional recording done (for awareness, not control)  

### Immediate Acceptance Gate
[ ] No safety issues upon placement  
[ ] No crew disruption  
[ ] No governance friction  

If early deployment feels “loud,” something is wrong.

---

## Section 4 — Behavioral Settlement

### Observed Behavior
[ ] Units allowed to settle into natural behavior  
[ ] No obsessive monitoring  
[ ] Drift observed calmly  
[ ] Minor repositioning only when clearly beneficial  
[ ] Underperformers retired without guilt  

If operational psychology tightens,
pause expansion.

---

## Section 5 — Validation & Acceptance

### Reality Check
[ ] Units do not cause operational burden  
[ ] Units provide at least modest benefit  
[ ] Units are tolerated by crews  
[ ] Leadership remains comfortable  
[ ] Governance remains stable  
[ ] Risk posture remains appropriately conservative  

### Acceptance Decision
[ ] Accepted  
[ ] Conditionally Accepted  
[ ] Not Accepted → Retire / remove  

Acceptance is optional.
Peace of mind is mandatory.

---

## Section 6 — Sustainment Behavior

### Long-Term Discipline
[ ] Units require minimal attention  
[ ] No “performance heroics” emerge  
[ ] Governance does not pressure for justification  
[ ] Data (if collected) is used informatively, not politically  

Sustainment should feel boring.
If it doesn’t, reassess.

---

## Section 7 — Drift Handling

[ ] Drift observed without panic  
[ ] Drift does not create hazard  
[ ] Drift does not create drama  
[ ] Drift does not require committees  
[ ] Drift does not drive emotional responses  

If drift becomes a “thing,” governance doctrine must reassert itself.

---

## Section 8 — End-of-Life

[ ] End-of-life triggers understood  
[ ] Retirement feels easy  
[ ] No guilt attached to removal  
[ ] Removal possible at any time  
[ ] Planetary protection compliance confirmed where applicable  

DCF never earns permanence.
Only permission.

---

## Section 9 — Organizational Health Check

[ ] No political ownership battles  
[ ] No symbolic attachment emerging  
[ ] No pressure to defend system value  
[ ] Leadership tone remains calm and pragmatic  

If DCF becomes emotionally or politically loaded,
execution maturity has failed.

---

## Final Execution Sanity Test

Leadership should be able to say honestly:

> “We understand it.  
> We control it.  
> It helps modestly.  
> It doesn’t hurt us.  
> If that changes, we’ll remove it.”

If that sentence is true,
execution is healthy.

If not,
stop and fix governance posture before proceeding.
