# Planetary Protection & Ethics Doctrine

## Purpose

This doctrine defines **how the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF)** aligns with:

- planetary protection responsibilities
- environmental stewardship
- mission ethics
- operational dignity
- cultural responsibility

The DCF is intentionally simple, passive, and low-impact.
That does not excuse laziness about ethics or planetary protection.

We take responsibility seriously —
calmly, rationally, and without drama.

---

## Foundational Position

Three truths frame this doctrine:

1️⃣ The mission comes first.  
2️⃣ Environmental responsibility is not optional.  
3️⃣ Ethics require maturity, not theatrics.

DCF must exist in a way that:
- respects planetary environments
- respects operational integrity
- respects public trust
- respects future missions

If DCF cannot coexist ethically,
it does not deserve to exist operationally.

---

## Ethical Operating Philosophy

The DCF must:

- do no meaningful harm
- not complicate lifecycle ethics
- remain discardable and accountable
- reduce operational friction rather than create it
- avoid becoming ethically “precious” or immune to criticism

Correct ethical posture:

> “We used it responsibly.  
> We monitored its presence.  
> If it ever becomes ethically questionable, we stop.”

Simple and adult.

---

## Planetary Protection Alignment

DCF deployment must comply with:

- mission planetary protection classification
- agency planetary protection rules
- mission-specific contamination policies
- environmental stewardship expectations

DCF does NOT get exemptions because it is “small” or “simple.”

If deployment governance or planetary protection leadership has reservations,
DCF yields.

No argument.
No pushback.
No persuasion campaign.

---

## Surface Integrity Responsibility

DCF must be deployed in a way that:

- respects terrain integrity
- avoids unnecessary surface disturbance
- does not encourage irresponsible placement
- avoids fragile geologic or scientifically sensitive zones

Correct mindset:
DCF belongs in operational, already-impacted zones —
not pristine, high-value science terrain.

If environmental or science leadership says “not here,”
we listen.

---

## Contamination Discipline

DCF must not:

- introduce contamination risk beyond mission norms
- violate sterilization expectations where required
- transit into zones classified above deployment readiness level
- become an uncontrolled environmental object

Where sterilization or contamination protocols apply,
DCF adheres to them.

If that becomes burdensome,
that is not an argument to weaken standards —
it is a signal that deployment is inappropriate.

---

## Abandonment & Residual Presence Ethics

DCF may be:

- retained
- relocated
- retired
- abandoned (if mission rules allow)

But abandonment must not be careless.

Where abandonment is allowed:
- it must align with planetary protection
- it must align with mission policy
- it must align with cultural and public trust expectations

Where abandonment is NOT allowed,
DCF must be retrieved or disposed of in compliant fashion.

Doctrine position:
Ethical stewardship outweighs convenience.

---

## Human Ethics & Institutional Responsibility

The DCF must not become:

- an excuse to push crews harder
- a reason to complicate EVA plans
- a justification to accept more risk
- a symbolic political asset
- a culture war inside the mission

If DCF creates human tension,
leadership has an ethical duty to correct posture, simplify, or remove it.

Humans > Hardware.
Always.

---

## Transparency Doctrine

DCF existence, purpose, and posture should be:

- easy to explain
- boring to justify
- not misleading
- not exaggerated

DCF does not require marketing mythologies.
It does not need heroic framing.
It should never be sold as more important than it is.

Honesty protects institutional trust.

---

## Ethics Failure Triggers

Ethics doctrine is failing if:

- DCF causes avoidable environmental harm
- DCF violates planetary protection boundaries
- ethical concerns are dismissed for convenience
- teams feel pressure to keep it regardless of concern
- abandonment becomes negligent rather than responsible
- DCF becomes politically defended rather than rationally governed

If any of these happen,
deployment halts until posture resets.

---

## Success Criteria

Planetary protection and ethics are successful if:

- compliance is respected
- surface integrity is treated responsibly
- abandonment / disposal is disciplined
- crews and leadership feel ethically comfortable
- governance remains transparent
- the system remains optional
- nobody feels forced to tolerate ethical discomfort

Ideal ethical posture sounds like:

> “We used it responsibly.  
> It behaved responsibly.  
> When it stopped being appropriate, we stopped.  
> That’s how responsible programs operate.”

---

## Final Ethical Position

DCF exists under a simple ethical contract:

- It is allowed to exist only while it behaves responsibly.
- It is allowed to exist only where it belongs.
- It is allowed to exist only when compliance is respected.
- It is allowed to exist only when leadership remains ethically comfortable.

The mission deserves maturity.
The environment deserves respect.
The crew deserves clarity.

DCF only belongs in programs that can honor all three.

That is the doctrine.
