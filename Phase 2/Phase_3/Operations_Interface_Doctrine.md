# Operations Interface Doctrine

## Purpose

This document defines **how the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) interfaces with real operations, real crews, and real mission workflows**.

This is not about control.
This is about coexistence.

The doctrine ensures:
- crews are not burdened
- operations are not interfered with
- leadership remains comfortable
- mission priorities never yield to DCF presence

DCF is infrastructure.
Infrastructure must behave like a respectful guest.

---

## Interface Philosophy

The DCF must:

- fit into operations
- not demand attention
- not require cultural buy-in
- not require emotional defense
- never become a “program that operators work around”

If operators feel like they are working *for* the DCF,
operational interface has failed.

---

## Primary Interface Rule

### **Mission First. DCF Always Yields.**

In any situation involving:
- EVA flow
- rover routing
- safety dynamics
- emergency response
- leadership discomfort
- operational friction

DCF loses instantly.

Correct action:
- move it
- ignore it
- retire it

No debate.
No emotion.
No ceremony.

---

## Operations Interface Boundaries

The DCF must never:

- shape mission planning
- define EVA choreography
- dictate rover movement
- require recurring procedure updates
- require training burden
- require crew compliance rituals
- force reporting obligations

If it needs operations to adapt,
it is the wrong fit.

---

## Crew Expectations

### What crews should NOT feel:

- obligated
- defensive
- responsible for proving value
- watched or evaluated over DCF handling
- pressured to treat it carefully

Crew psychology matters more than performance numbers.

---

### What crews ARE encouraged to do:

- ignore it most of the time
- naturally move around it
- interact only when convenient
- suggest relocation when obvious
- recommend retirement when tired of it

Operator preference is valid input.
No justification necessary.

---

## Routine Interaction Model

Normal operations behavior should look like:

- DCF is visible
- DCF is tolerated
- DCF is occasionally emptied (if relevant)
- DCF is occasionally adjusted
- DCF is often forgotten about

Silence is success.

If there is a recurring conversation about DCF,
something went wrong culturally.

---

## Interface With EVA Operations

DCF must:

- not complicate suit movement
- not add cognitive overhead
- not force additional EVA tasking
- not feel like “one more thing to worry about”

EVA operators should view DCF as:

> “Background infrastructure that doesn’t bother me.”

If EVA teams ever view it as burden,
governance should intervene and simplify.

---

## Interface With Rover & Surface Mobility

DCF should:

- live adjacent to travel paths, not in them
- respect turning radius realities
- never force detours
- never cause hesitation
- never threaten collision risk

If rover operators hesitate near a DCF unit,
that deployment was wrong.

Remove or relocate.
Do not defend.

---

## Interface With Safety Culture

DCF must not:

- complicate risk assessments
- demand recurring hazard reviews
- require protective framing
- introduce gray-zone uncertainty

If a safety team feels unsure,
trust safety instinct and adjust deployment posture.

Safety > DCF.
Always.

---

## Interface With Leadership

Leadership should experience DCF as:

- calm
- controlled
- optional
- non-political
- low bandwidth

Leadership should never feel:

- pressure to defend it
- fear of criticism for removing it
- trapped by previous decisions
- forced to justify outcomes

Healthy leadership posture sounds like:

> “We use it because it’s helpful.  
> If someday it isn’t, we’ll stop.  
> Simple.”

---

## Organizational Interface

DCF must not become:

- a recurring meeting topic
- a permanent discussion item
- an institutional identity asset
- a “stakeholder vision emblem”
- a career narrative for anyone

If DCF appears too often in leadership decks,
the doctrine has drifted.

---

## Interface Failure Signs

Operations interface is failing if:

- operators complain frequently
- leadership feels pressure
- governance becomes political
- people argue emotionally for or against it
- DCF shows up in cultural friction conversations
- DCF feels like “another program”

These are not technical failures.
They are organizational warning lights.

Corrective action: simplify or remove.

---

## Interface Success Definition

Operations interface is successful if:

- crews tolerate it
- leadership is relaxed
- governance is calm
- mission does not notice it much
- it occasionally helps
- nobody feels trapped by decisions

The ideal operational sentence is:

> “Yeah, it’s there. It helps a bit.  
> It doesn’t bother anyone.  
> We keep the useful ones and get rid of the annoying ones.  
> It’s fine.”

That is success.

---

## Final Operations Interface Position

DCF exists **inside** operations,
not above them.

It is allowed to exist only while it remains:

- safe
- tolerable
- quiet
- boring
- optional

If those conditions stop being true,
operations doctrine demands decisive correction.

Mission wins.
People win.
DCF is allowed to exist only when it behaves with humility.

That is the doctrine.
