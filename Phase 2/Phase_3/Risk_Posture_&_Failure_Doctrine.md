# Risk Posture & Failure Doctrine

## Purpose

This document defines the **risk posture** and **failure doctrine** for Phase 3 execution of the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF).

This is where we answer, without theatrics:

- What risks do we actually accept?
- What risks do we reject?
- How do we behave when things go wrong?
- What does failure mean?
- What does failure NOT mean?

This doctrine exists to prevent panic, hype, denial, and overreaction.

---

## Risk Philosophy

DCF follows a deliberately conservative risk philosophy:

- **Low operational risk tolerance**
- **High performance humility**
- **High acceptance of benign failure**
- **Zero tolerance for political or bureaucratic spirals**

The DCF is intended to exist as **safe infrastructure**, not as a high-stakes technological bet.

If the risk culture around DCF feels “tense,”
execution maturity has failed.

---

## Core Risk Posture

### ✔ Acceptable Risks
The following risks are acceptable:

- Some units provide minimal benefit
- Some units drift into uselessness
- Some units require occasional repositioning
- Some units are eventually ignored
- Variability in performance between units
- Imperfect data about effectiveness
- Quiet retirement of units that don’t justify themselves

These risks align with the project’s identity:
passive, supplemental, non-heroic.

---

### ❌ Unacceptable Risks
The following are NOT acceptable:

- sustained crew hazard
- tripping or collision risk that leadership cannot comfortably justify
- interference with EVA choreography
- interference with rover safety or routing
- becoming a policy, turf, or governance battleground
- becoming psychologically “untouchable” or politically defended
- requiring constant management effort
- requiring heroics to justify continued existence

If any of the above appear,
risk posture demands decisive correction.

---

## Failure Doctrine

Failure is not a scandal.
Failure is simply state change.

DCF failure doctrine is built around three rules:

---

### Rule 1 — Failure Must Be Boring

DCF must fail like responsible infrastructure:

- slowly
- predictably
- without noise
- without emergency response
- without governance chaos

If a DCF failure produces:
- public drama
- institutional embarrassment
- political theater

that is institutional immaturity,
not DCF technical failure.

---

### Rule 2 — Failure Must Not Harm Operations

DCF is allowed to:
- stop contributing
- drift out of relevance
- become unnecessary

DCF is not allowed to:
- endanger people
- complicate critical operations
- impose workload
- hijack leadership bandwidth

If the DCF ever threatens mission priorities,
its right to exist instantly evaporates.

---

### Rule 3 — Failure Must End Quietly

The correct failure conclusion is:

> “We stopped using some.  
> We retired others.  
> Some still help.  
> No big deal.”

Retirement should feel:
- simple
- guilt-free
- non-emotional
- routine

If retirement feels like “giving up,”  
the doctrine has been misunderstood.

---

## Failure Modes

---

### ✔ Benign Failure (Preferred)

Definition:
- System becomes useless or marginally useful
- But creates no hazard, no burden, no drama

Examples:
- buried into irrelevance
- performance fades
- ignored into obsolescence

Correct response:
- shrug
- optionally move
- optionally retire

Status:
**Fully acceptable**

---

### ⚠ Nuisance Failure (Tolerable)

Definition:
- System continues existing but requires mild attention
- Annoyance but not danger

Examples:
- repeatedly awkward placement
- frequently full
- occasionally in the way

Correct response:
- fix once
- or stop caring
- or remove entirely

Status:
**Acceptable if infrequent; otherwise retire**

---

### ❌ Unacceptable Failure

Definition:
- System materially harms or burdens the mission

Examples:
- causes crew safety risk
- creates persistent interference
- requires governance escalation
- becomes political
- requires defending its existence

Correct response:
- immediate corrective action
- likely retirement
- governance reset if political patterns emerge

Status:
**Not tolerated**

---

## Incident Handling Policy

If a failure or issue occurs:

1️⃣ Assess operational risk first  
Safety and interference always trump environmental benefit.

2️⃣ Apply the simplest correction  
Move it, remove it, discard it.

3️⃣ Avoid bureaucratic gravity  
Do not default into reporting culture unless required for safety compliance.

4️⃣ Protect morale  
Do not shame crews or leaders for removing units.

5️⃣ Preserve doctrine  
Reassert discardability and non-precious status.

---

## No-Blame Doctrine

DCF execution explicitly rejects:
- blame assignment
- embarrassment culture
- narrative damage control
- prestige preservation
- posturing

If a unit caused annoyance and was removed,
the correct institutional sentence is:

> “Good. That’s how it’s supposed to work.”

---

## Escalation Boundaries

Escalation is only warranted if:

- persistent risk exists
- governance failure is apparent
- systemic misdeployment patterns emerge
- units repeatedly violate doctrine expectations

Escalation is NOT warranted for:
- individual failing units
- mediocre performance
- leadership indifference
- quiet irrelevance

Most outcomes do not need escalation.
They need perspective.

---

## Organizational Failure Indicators

DCF failure has moved beyond technical risk
and into organizational dysfunction if:

- strong political opinions form around it
- leaders defend or attack it symbolically
- crews resent it loudly
- success requires narrative energy
- failure requires institutional face-saving

At that point,
the correct move is to stop deployments
until leadership reframes expectations.

---

## Risk Success Criteria

Risk posture is successful if:

- operations leadership never feels exposed
- crews never feel endangered
- governance remains calm and simple
- failure states feel boring
- retirement decisions feel easy
- nobody feels pressure to believe in DCF

If leadership can say:

> “We understand the risk.  
> We control it.  
> If it ever becomes annoying or dangerous, we’ll just get rid of it.”

then risk posture is healthy.

---

## Final Risk Position

DCF Phase 3 risk posture commits to:

- conservative operational risk tolerance
- high acceptance of benign failure
- zero acceptance of political drama
- disciplined calm leadership behavior

Failure is acceptable.
Risk is manageable.
Pressure is unnecessary.

DCF exists only so long as it remains safe, quiet, useful,
and easy to ignore on bad days.

That is the doctrine.
