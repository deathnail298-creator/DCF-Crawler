# Phase 3 — Drift Model

## Purpose

This document defines **how the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) will drift over time once deployed**, and how organizations should interpret, respond to, and manage that drift without panic, bureaucracy, or misplaced expectation.

Everything deployed to a real surface environment will:
- change
- degrade
- drift away from ideal states

Phase 3 accepts this as reality instead of pretending it won’t happen.

Drift is not failure.
Drift is the normal operating state of long-lived surface assets.

---

## What “Drift” Means in Phase 3

In Phase 3, **Drift** includes:

- performance drift  
- positional drift  
- environmental drift  
- human-behavior drift  
- relevance drift  

Drift = the difference between intended deployment state
and the state the system naturally evolves into.

The DCF must remain useful in the real world,
not just the planned world.

---

## Drift Philosophy

DCF execution policy accepts the following truths:

- Nothing stays optimized.
- Nothing stays aligned with the original plan.
- Dust, environment, and crew behavior will reshape outcomes.
- Some units will exceed expectations.
- Some units will quietly become irrelevant.

DCF execution succeeds when drift:
- does not create risk,
- does not create administrative burden,
- and does not create emotional or political drama.

If drift results in meetings,
something has gone wrong in governance, not engineering.

## Drift Categories

---

### 1️⃣ Performance Drift

Over time:
- capture efficiency may change
- internal geometry may evolve
- flow patterns may stabilize at new baselines

This is **expected**.

#### Acceptable Response
- monitor casually
- do nothing if useful contribution remains
- redeploy or ignore when usefulness fades

---

### 2️⃣ Environmental Drift

Units may experience:
- partial burial
- dust reshaping
- terrain interaction changes

Some units may become better.
Some may become useless.

#### Acceptable Response
- leave in place if harmless
- move if convenient
- retire if pointless

There is no obligation to rescue drifted units.

---

### 3️⃣ Positional Drift

DCF that once sat in a great location
may eventually be in the wrong place.

- operations shift
- traffic corridors change
- wind behavior changes
- habitats expand
- the world moves on

#### Acceptable Response
- reposition
- abandon
- replace elsewhere
- don’t overthink

DCF is infrastructure,
not a museum exhibit.

---

### 4️⃣ Human Behavior Drift

Real crews:
- change priorities
- stop paying attention to background infrastructure
- favor familiar tools
- ignore low-noise systems
- sometimes forget assets exist at all

This is normal human behavior, not failure.

#### Acceptable Response
If the crew stops caring:
- either the asset was never valuable
- or its benefit was so low-maintenance it faded into “ambient”

Both outcomes are survivable.
Neither justifies panic.

---

### 5️⃣ Relevance Drift

Over time,
mission context changes.

- other systems improve
- mission operations evolve
- new technologies appear
- dust environment stabilizes
- or leadership simply stops caring

DCF may drift from “useful contributor”
to
“fine but unnecessary background item.”

#### Acceptable Response
Accept it.
Infrastructure relevance changes.

Retire it without guilt.

---

## Drift Doctrine

DCF Phase 3 drift doctrine is intentionally simple:

- Drift is expected.
- Drift is allowed.
- Drift is not a crisis.
- Drift does not require investigation.
- Drift does not demand correction unless it causes harm.

If a unit drifts into uselessness and nobody notices for six months,
that is not a failure — that is proof the system never became a burden.

---

## Drift Decision Ladder

When drift is observed, the correct question sequence is:

1️⃣ Is it causing risk?  
If yes → move / retire immediately.

2️⃣ Is it creating meaningful burden?  
If yes → simplify / reposition / retire.

3️⃣ Is it providing noticeable value?  
If yes → leave it.

4️⃣ Is it neutral background clutter?  
If yes → optional removal.

No philosophy.
No ceremony.
No committees.

---

## Organizational Drift Boundary

If drift leads to:

- governance escalation  
- blame cycles  
- incident reviews  
- policy renewal  
- political pressure  

then the failure is **organizational maturity**, not DCF design.

The correct mitigation:
- reset expectations
- reaffirm discardability
- reinforce non-precious doctrine

---

## What Drift Should NOT Become

Drift should never become:

- a safety hazard
- a bureaucratic weight
- a budget hostage
- a “legacy artifact”
- a symbolic asset
- a political trophy

If someone starts talking about “DCF heritage assets,”
something has gone deeply wrong culturally.

---

## Drift Success Criteria

Drift is being handled successfully if:

- units fade naturally into their equilibrium usefulness
- nobody is stressed about underperforming units
- moving or discarding units feels easy and normal
- no unit becomes emotionally protected
- planners treat drift as an environmental behavior, not an engineering defect

The best outcome is this sentence:

> “Yeah, some shifted, some buried, some still help.  
> It’s fine.”

That’s drift success.

---

## Final Drift Reality Position

DCF Phase 3 execution accepts:

- entropy
- change
- time
- disinterest
- evolution

The job isn’t to fight drift.
The job is to make sure drift never hurts the mission.

If the worst thing that happens is some quiet wasted metal on the surface,
Phase 3 drift handling succeeded.
