# End-of-Life & Disposition Doctrine

## Purpose

This document defines how the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) reaches the end of its useful life — and what happens next.

End-of-life doctrine exists to:
- avoid guilt-based retention
- prevent bureaucratic inertia
- keep the system discardable
- ensure mission priorities always win
- maintain dignity and maturity in leadership decisions

DCF is infrastructure.
Infrastructure must be removable without drama.

---

## End-of-Life Philosophy

Surface assets do not all deserve permanent life.

The DCF must never become:
- a symbolic legacy artifact
- a “program identity anchor”
- something leaders feel obligated to sustain
- something operators feel guilty abandoning

Correct mindset:
> “It served while it served. When it stops mattering, we let it go.”

---

## What Triggers End-of-Life?

Any of the following conditions justify end-of-life:

- it stops providing recognizable benefit
- it drifts into irrelevance
- it becomes persistently annoying
- it becomes a clutter perception issue
- leadership confidence drops
- governance maturity weakens
- operational landscape changes
- new systems make it obsolete
- nobody wants to think about it anymore
- it simply feels unnecessary

DCF does not need to “fail” to be retired.
It only needs to stop earning attention.

---

## Emergency Retirement Triggers

Immediate removal is justified if:

- safety risk appears
- EVA routing impact emerges
- rover interaction risk appears
- debris / collision risk grows
- leadership anxiety rises materially
- politics or drama attach to it
- doctrinal principles are violated

In emergency retirement:
- no investigation required beyond compliance minimums
- no justification burden
- no narrative repair effort

Remove.
Move on.

---

## Retirement Authority

Authority rests with:

### **Surface Infrastructure / Site Operations Leadership**

They may:
- remove a single unit
- remove a cluster
- remove all units
- suspend deployments
- permanently cancel deployment programs

They do NOT owe:
- external defenders justification
- symbolic preservation commitments
- proof that retirement is “fair”

Ownership means authority.

## Retirement Options

When DCF reaches end-of-life, valid outcomes include:

### ✔ Relocation to Storage
If future reconsideration is plausible.

### ✔ Redeployment Elsewhere
If other locations appear more suitable.

### ✔ Disassembly & Recycling
If materials or mass value persists.

### ✔ Permanent Abandonment (Mission Rules Permitting)
If environmental constraints, mass logistics, or mission design make abandonment permissible and compliant.

### ✔ Controlled Disposal
If mission doctrine requires structured retirement.

Any of these are legitimate.
None require guilt.

## No-Guilt Retirement Doctrine

Leadership and crews must NOT:

- feel defensive about removal
- feel pressured to justify why
- feel like retirement is failure
- feel institutional embarrassment

Retirement is a discipline action,
not an emotional action.

If retirement feels like “defeat,” doctrine is broken.

---

## Documentation Expectations

Minimum necessary documentation is encouraged:

- short operational note
- reason category (optional)
- time/date
- decision authority

Do NOT create:
- elaborate reports
- technical epilogues
- historical memorials

DCF does not require ceremony.

---

## Handling Partial Fleet Retirement

It is completely acceptable to:

- remove some units
- retain others
- let fleet composition evolve

Uniformity is not required.
Fleet asymmetry is normal.

If unit diversity causes anxiety,
reset expectations — not deployments.

---

## Cultural Discipline Guardrail

The DCF must never progress into:

- entitled infrastructure
- culturally “protected” hardware
- emotionally defended assets
- reputation stakes

If defenders appear, doctrine requires reaffirmation:

> “This is passive infrastructure.  
> If it stops being useful or tolerable, we remove it.”

End of discussion.

---

## Planetary Protection Context

Where planetary protection and environmental disposal rules apply:

- those rules override convenience
- compliance is not optional
- doctrine does not excuse negligence

End-of-life discipline must be aligned with regulatory reality.

If compliance creates friction,
then deployment expectations were wrong — not the rules.

---

## End-of-Life Success Definition

End-of-life handling is successful if:

- removal decisions feel calm and easy
- no one feels guilt
- no one feels pressured to defend retention
- removal does not create drama
- mission priorities clearly remain superior
- leadership feels completely at peace saying:
  > “We’re done with it.”

That is success.

---

## Final Position

DCF is allowed to exist only so long as it remains:

- safe
- tolerable
- boring
- low-burden
- modestly useful

The moment those conditions cease to hold,
end-of-life doctrine empowers decisive, guilt-free action.

DCF never earns permanence.
It only earns permission — for as long as it deserves it.
