# Failure Post-Mortem Template

## Purpose

This template exists to document failures related to the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) in a disciplined, non-emotional, and non-political way.

It is not:
- a blame document
- a reputation protection vehicle
- a justification exercise
- a performance defense artifact

It is simply:
- truth
- clarity
- learning

If this template becomes dramatic,
someone is misusing it.

## 1️⃣ Event Summary

**Date:**  
**Location / Deployment Zone:**  
**Unit(s) Involved:**  
**Primary Point of Contact:**  

**Short Plain-Language Description of What Happened:**

## 2️⃣ Classification of Failure

Select the most appropriate category:

**Explanation (short, factual):**

---

## 3️⃣ What Actually Went Wrong

Short description of cause and behavior:

- Was this environmental?
- Operational?
- Governance / culture?
- Deployment placement?
- Natural drift?
- Something else?

**Plain-Language Description:**  
*(Avoid engineering theater. Be honest.)*

## 4️⃣ Impact Assessment

**Operational Impact:**  
- ☐ None  
- ☐ Mild Annoyance  
- ☐ Noticeable Disruption  
- ☐ Safety Concern  
- ☐ Significant Operational Conflict

## 5️⃣ Safety & Risk Reflection

Did this create **any** safety risk?

- ☐ Over-Optimistic Expectation
- ☐ Governance Weakness
- ☐ Cultural / Political Distortion
- ☐ Design Limitation
- ☐ Operational Misuse
- ☐ Unknown / Not Worth Over-Investigating

This is not an engineering thesis.
Clarity > complexity.

## 8️⃣ Corrective Action

What was done?

- ☐ Moved
- ☐ Repositioned
- ☐ Retired

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Closure Statement

Short final conclusion:

> “Here is what happened.  
> Here is what we did.  
> Here is what we learned.  
> No drama required.”

**Final Closure Notes:**

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Approval

**Reviewed By:**  
**Date:**  

Signature not required.
Confidence is behavioral, not ceremonial.

---

## Final Reminder

DCF failure is not scandal.
Failure is a valid program state.

Desired tone of conclusion:
- calm
- mature
- pragmatic
- guilt-free

If we can quietly say:
> “It failed in a boring way,
> we handled it,
> the mission was never threatened,”

then the system behaved correctly — even in failure.

That is success.
