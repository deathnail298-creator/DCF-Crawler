# Field Deployment Doctrine

## Purpose

This document defines **how the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) should be physically deployed in the field** in a way that is:

- disciplined
- safe
- low-burden
- operationally respectful
- aligned with governance and risk doctrine

This is not improvisation guidance.
This is structured deployment discipline.

---

## Deployment Philosophy

DCF field deployment is guided by five truths:

1️⃣ Field environments do not care about intent.  
2️⃣ Operators have real work to do; DCF must not compete with it.  
3️⃣ Deployment must never feel like a burden or political statement.  
4️⃣ Placement should be cautious, conservative, and calm.  
5️⃣ Every unit must remain discardable at all times.

If field deployment becomes complicated or dramatic,
deployment doctrine has already failed.

---

## Deployment Authorization Boundary

Deployment is only allowed when:

- Ownership = **Surface Infrastructure / Site Operations**
- Execution Governance is acknowledged
- Risk Posture is accepted
- Retirement authority is explicitly clear
- Phase 3 execution license is approved

If any ownership or governance uncertainty remains,
deployment does not proceed.

---

## Deployment Intent

DCF units are deployed to:

- quietly intercept airborne or mobilized dust
- exist passively
- provide incremental environmental conditioning over time
- do so without disturbing primary mission operations

DCF units are **not** deployed to:
- prove capability
- win political points
- demonstrate “innovation”
- test aggressive hypotheses
- justify someone’s career arc

They are tools, not symbols.

---

## Deployment Zone Principles

### Priority Zones
Deploy preferentially in areas that demonstrate:

- repeated EVA foot traffic
- repeated rover motion
- churn zones where dust is regularly disturbed
- perimeter wind corridors
- boundary regions between active and inactive terrain

These areas offer most value with least interference.

---

### Avoidance Zones
Do NOT deploy in:

- tight EVA choreography lanes
- zones with high stumble hazard risk
- narrow vehicle maneuvering corridors
- locations where emergency routing priority exists
- areas near fragile or symbolic infrastructure
- visually sensitive “political optics” zones

If leadership hesitates visually or culturally,
deployment should move elsewhere.

---

## Placement Doctrine

Correct placement characteristics:

- adjacent to traffic, not inside traffic
- predictable to crews
- visible enough to avoid collision
- stable footing / terrain contact
- aligned with environmental flow where possible

Incorrect placement characteristics:

- “surprise objects” in human paths
- closely hugging sensitive equipment
- inside compact operational choreography
- psychologically annoying to crew

If a location feels contentious,
it is probably the wrong location.

---

## Deployment Density

Deployment should avoid both extremes:

- **not too dense** (clutter risk)
- **not too sparse** (ineffective ecosystem)

Doctrine position:

- start small
- allow operational experience to reveal scaling value
- never deploy in volume simply to create statistical justification
- expansion must always feel optional, not inevitable

If leaders feel pressure to “scale up,”
doctrine has failed.

---

## Deployment Procedure Model

---

### Step 1 — Site Survey & Intent Confirmation
- confirm governance ownership
- confirm deployment objective zone
- confirm no immediate hazard conflicts
- ensure retreat / removal pathway exists

---

### Step 2 — Conservative Placement
- place minimal viable number of units
- avoid ambitious optimization
- prefer “safe but decent” over “perfect but risky”

Tone:
> Start humbly.

---

### Step 3 — Settle-in Period
- allow environment and operations to interact
- no rapid redeployment swings
- no defensive justification reports
- allow drift to shape truth

Tone:
> Let reality shape the outcome.

---

### Step 4 — Gentle Adjustment Phase
- reposition obvious outliers
- remove clear failures
- leave marginal-but-harmless units alone
- avoid over-optimization

Tone:
> Light touch.

---

### Step 5 — Sustainment or Retirement
- normalize presence where useful
- quietly retire what isn’t
- enforce discardability
- refuse emotional attachment

Tone:
> Calm permanence, not dependence.

---

## Deployment Behavior Expectations

During field life, DCF units will:

- be ignored a lot
- occasionally be helpful
- sometimes seem pointless
- sometimes be in the wrong place
- sometimes be surprisingly useful
- eventually drift in relevance

This is normal.
Deployment doctrine plans for this rather than fighting it.

---

## Crew Interaction Boundary

Crew expectations:

They should NOT:
- defend the system
- feel obligated to justify it
- feel burdened by its existence
- be required to handle special procedures

They SHOULD:
- avoid it naturally
- engage only when convenient
- reposition only when clearly useful
- feel free to suggest removal

If crews resent the system,
deployment doctrine must correct.

---

## Emergency Priority Rule

In any situation involving:
- EVA safety
- emergency routing
- rover clearance emergencies
- habitat access pressure

DCF loses instantly.

Correct doctrine response:
- move it
- throw it aside
- retire it permanently
- do not apologize

Mission > DCF always.

No debate.

---

## Deployment Failure Conditions

Deployment is considered failing if:

- clutter perception becomes persistent
- crew complains frequently
- leadership feels cultural friction
- governance becomes politicized
- removal becomes emotionally resisted
- effort is required to justify existence

If deployment feels *heavy*, it is wrong.

---

## Deployment Success Definition

Deployment is successful if field teams say:

> “Yeah, they’re around.  
> They don’t bother us.  
> Some are useful.  
> Some we got rid of.  
> Overall, they’re fine.”

This is mature success.

DCF wins by being tolerable, not spectacular.

---

## Final Deployment Position

DCF field deployment doctrine commits to:

- conservative placement
- deliberate execution
- zero-drama integration
- safety-first prioritization
- persistent discardability

Deployment only has value so long as:
- crews tolerate it
- leadership remains calm
- governance does not harden
- retirement stays easy

If those conditions hold,
field deployment doctrine has succeeded.
