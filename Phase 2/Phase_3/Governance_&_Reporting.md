# Governance & Reporting

## Purpose

This document defines how governance and reporting operate during Phase 3 execution of the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF).

The goals:
- keep ownership clear
- keep reporting sane
- prevent bureaucratic gravity
- avoid political pressure
- maintain calm, adult oversight

Governance exists to preserve discipline,
not to build a bureaucratic monument.

---

## Governance Philosophy

DCF governance is built on five truths:

1️⃣ Ownership must be clear.
2️⃣ Responsibility must feel safe.
3️⃣ Reporting must be minimal but meaningful.
4️⃣ Politics must never accumulate.
5️⃣ Removal must always remain easy.

If governance becomes heavy,
governance has failed.

---

## Governance Ownership

Primary execution ownership resides with:

### **Surface Infrastructure / Site Operations Leadership**

They control:
- deployment approval
- redeployment decisions
- acceptance posture
- retirement and disposition
- program continuation or cessation

They do NOT owe:
- external validation theater
- performance protection
- symbolic defense

Ownership means freedom to decide rationally.

---

## Supporting Stakeholders

Stakeholders who *may* contribute without owning:

- EVA operations (feedback, routing awareness)
- rover operations (routing considerations)
- safety teams (safety alignment)
- science / analytics (optional data study)
- mission leadership (strategic support)

They may:
- advise
- observe
- analyze
- recommend

They may not:
- override ownership
- politicize outcomes
- demand justification for removal
- force performance expectations

---

## Governance Objectives

Governance should ensure:

- deployments are intentional
- accountability exists without fear
- risk posture remains grounded
- mission priorities outrank DCF
- decisions stay boring and rational
- removal is always an available option

If leaders feel “trapped” by the program,
governance posture must reset.

---

## Reporting Philosophy

Reporting must remain:

- minimal
- pragmatic
- operationally respectful
- non-theatrical

Reporting exists to maintain awareness,
not to prove success or defend existence.

If reporting feels like marketing,
it has gone wrong.

---

## Reporting Requirements

### Baseline Reporting (Minimum)

- deployment acknowledgment
- basic location awareness
- simple operational status summary:
  - “acceptable”
  - “marginal”
  - “retire candidate”

No complex charts required.
No showmanship expected.

---

### Optional Reporting (If Useful)

Optional reporting may include:

- observational notes
- informal crew sentiment
- light performance indicators
- general environmental behavior comments

Optional does **not** mean expected.
Optional does **not** mean eventually required.

---

### Prohibited Reporting Culture

Reporting must NOT become:

- scheduled burdens
- performance defense briefings
- political messaging
- justification exercises
- narrative manufacturing

DCF is not a prestige project.
Reporting must not become theater.

---

## Review Cadence

Governance review cadence should be:

- infrequent
- quiet
- simple

Suggested rhythm:

- initial deployment review after reasonable field time
- then periodic light-touch check-ins only when operationally relevant

No quarterly business reviews.
No recurring burden cycles.
No leadership ritualizations.

---

## Governance Intervention Triggers

Governance intervention is warranted when:

- safety concerns appear
- clutter / interference perception grows
- political pressure emerges
- ownership confusion appears
- reporting escalates unnecessarily
- crews begin to resent the system
- DCF becomes a recurring agenda item

When intervention is triggered,
governance has one job:

> simplify, reassure, discard if needed.

---

## Reporting Roles

- **Operators:** provide incidental/lived feedback
- **Custodians / Local Ops Support:** record significant observations only
- **Surface Ops Leadership:** evaluate need for decisions
- **Stakeholders:** provide advisory commentary if relevant

Nobody should be “defending” the DCF in reports.
Nobody should feel threatened by truth.

---

## Governance Failure Modes

Governance is failing if:

- nobody knows who owns DCF
- removal requires argument
- acceptance requires hype
- reports feel defensive
- leaders feel compelled to justify continued existence
- DCF becomes politically important
- crews feel constrained by governance rules

If governance becomes loud,
it must reset to calm.

---

## Governance Success Criteria

Governance is successful if:

- ownership remains unambiguous
- leaders feel relaxed and confident
- operators feel unburdened
- reporting remains light and useful
- discipline is maintained without anxiety
- nobody feels trapped by outcomes
- removal never feels controversial

Healthy governance tone sounds like:

> “We’re aware of it, it’s fine, and if it ever stops being fine, we’ll just remove it.”

That is success.

---

## Final Governance Position

Phase 3 governance exists to ensure:

- responsible execution
- stable leadership confidence
- zero political gravity
- sustainable operational behavior
- permanent discardability

Governance protects mission priorities,
crew sanity,
and leadership composure.

If governance remains calm,
DCF execution remains healthy.

That is the standard.
