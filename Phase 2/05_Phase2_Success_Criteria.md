# 05 — Phase 2 Success Criteria

## Purpose

Phase 2 is not about hardware, fabrication, or testing.

Phase 2 exists to:
- create disciplined clarity
- remove ambiguity
- define realistic expectations
- enable sober decision-making
- prevent hype, fantasy engineering, and misplaced confidence

Phase 2 succeeds if the program is easier to think about.
It fails if the program becomes louder instead of clearer.

## What “Success” Means in Phase 2

Phase 2 is successful if:

- stakeholders understand exactly what the DCF is
- stakeholders understand exactly what the DCF is not
- leadership has confidence in the *real* behavior profile
- there is zero confusion about operational intent
- nobody is guessing about integration
- nobody feels like this was oversold

If Phase 2 ends and people feel grounded rather than excited,
that is the correct outcome.

---

## Core Success Criteria

Phase 2 is considered successful when the following conditions are met:

---

### ✔ Clarity of Role & Limits

It must be unambiguous that the DCF is:

- passive
- supplemental
- incremental
- non-heroic
- non-critical infrastructure

And equally clear that it is **not**:
- a dust suppression system
- a mission-essential asset
- a primary environmental control
- fragile hardware that demands sympathy

Success = shared understanding with no mythology.

---

### ✔ Integration Is Plausible Without Drama

Mission planners must reasonably conclude:

- “Yes, this could live on a surface site.”
- “No, it doesn’t fight for attention or budget.”
- “Yes, it can exist without politics.”
- “No, it doesn’t require special nurturing.”

If the DCF requires committees to exist,
Phase 2 has failed.

---

### ✔ Reliability Expectations Are Realistic

Stakeholders should walk away with:

- grounded expectations about lifetime
- grounded expectations about failure
- confidence in benign failure modes
- zero illusions about perfection
- acceptance that some units will be useless

If anyone believes this always works everywhere,
Phase 2 failed to be honest.

---

### ✔ Risk Is Understood and Contained

Phase 2 succeeds when:

- risks are acknowledged openly
- risks do not feel existential
- mitigations feel sane and achievable
- failure outcomes feel manageable and boring

If risks feel hidden or sugar-coated,
Phase 2 has failed its entire purpose.

---

### ✔ Ownership & Governance Are Not Confusing

It should be clear that DCF belongs under:
- **Surface Infrastructure / Site Operations**

Success criteria:
- there is a logical owner
- there is no turf war
- there is no governance drama
- discard / relocation authority is clear

Ambiguity kills infrastructure.
If ownership remains vague, Phase 2 did not do its job.

---

### ✔ Decision-Support Outcome Is Achieved

The real deliverable of Phase 2 is decision confidence.

Decision makers should be able to say:

> “I understand it.  
> I understand the value.  
> I understand the risk.  
> I understand the lifecycle.  
> I understand the cost profile.  
> I understand that we can stop anytime.”

If leadership cannot make a rational decision after Phase 2,
then Phase 2 failed — regardless of how clever the content is.

---

## Indicators of Phase 2 Failure

Phase 2 has failed if:

- hype replaces clarity  
- people start overselling it  
- planners still feel uncertain  
- engineers still feel like assumptions are fuzzy  
- operations teams feel threatened or annoyed  
- risk language feels like corporate optimism  

Or worst case:
- Nobody feels like they actually *learned anything real.*

---

## Final Phase 2 Success Test

Phase 2 is successful if a skeptical operations leader reads Phase 2 and reacts like this:

> “Yeah.  
> This is small.  
> This is honest.  
> I understand it.  
> It won’t hurt us.  
> It might quietly help.  
> And if it doesn’t, we throw it away.  
> Fine.”

That’s success.

---

## Phase 2 Completion Meaning

When Phase 2 is “done,” it does **not** mean:
- “This is approved.”
- “This must exist.”
- “This is important.”

It simply means:

> The concept is fully understood, grounded in reality, and ready for a rational Phase 3 conversation if desired.

That is the only correct definition of Phase 2 maturity.
