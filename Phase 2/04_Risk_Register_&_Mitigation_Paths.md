# 04 — Risk Register & Mitigation Paths

## Purpose

This document defines the real risks associated with the Dust Capture & Feed Unit (DCF) and establishes clear, disciplined mitigation logic.

This is not a marketing document.
This is not a “confidence theater” artifact.
This is a sober risk framing grounded in:

- lunar / planetary surface reality
- human behavior reality
- logistics reality
- operational culture reality

If a risk exists, it’s listed.
If a mitigation is weak, it stays weak.
Honesty outperforms polish.

---

## Risk Philosophy

DCF risks fall into three categories:

1️⃣ **Operational Risk**  
Things that impact crew, rovers, or mission workflows.

2️⃣ **Infrastructure Risk**  
Things that create clutter, burden, maintenance debt, or governance drama.

3️⃣ **Performance Risk**  
Things that impact whether the DCF is even worth having.

DCF is intentionally designed so that risks trend toward annoyance or irrelevance,
not toward hazard or catastrophe.

If risks grow into policy fights,
the system has failed at a deeper level than engineering.

## Risk Register

---

### R1 — Tripping / Obstruction Hazard

**Description:**  
Improper placement could interfere with EVA foot traffic or rover maneuvering.

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Risk Category:** Operational

**Mitigation:**
- Perimeter-first placement doctrine (Phase 2 Integration Plan)
- Clear non-interference rule
- Ownership under Surface Infrastructure / Site Operations
- Right to remove at any time without debate

**Residual Risk:**  
Low when deployed with discipline. Medium if ignored.

---

### R2 — Becoming “Clutter Infrastructure”

**Description:**  
DCF risks turning into surface junk that nobody feels empowered to remove, adding mental and logistical drag.

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Risk Category:** Infrastructure

**Mitigation:**
- Explicit doctrine: discard is always acceptable
- Cultural framing: not “precious” equipment
- Intentional redundancy philosophy
- “Quiet retirement” acceptance model

**Residual Risk:**  
Moderate but controllable. Heavily dependent on leadership behavior.

---

### R3 — Being Ignored into Uselessness

**Description:**  
DCF could simply be neglected, never emptied, never positioned thoughtfully, and therefore contribute nothing.

**Likelihood:** High  
**Impact:** Low  
**Risk Category:** Performance

**Mitigation:**
- System intentionally requires almost no attention
- Works passively when ignored
- Even occasional incidental emptying is enough
- Benefit compounds with time rather than activity

**Residual Risk:**  
Moderate. Acceptable. This risk does not harm operations.

---

### R4 — Over-Expectations / Misrepresentation Risk

**Description:**  
Someone attempts to sell or interpret DCF as:
- critical dust mitigation
- primary environmental control
- mission dependency asset

This creates political and reputational risk.

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium to High  
**Risk Category:** Organizational

**Mitigation:**
- Phase 0 and Phase 2 framing explicitly reject “heroic” positioning
- Language consistency: passive, small, incremental benefit
- Repeated reminders that this is ambient conditioning, not a solution

**Residual Risk:**  
Low if documentation is respected.
Higher if organizational hype culture engages.

---

### R5 — Localized Burial / Drift Failure

**Description:**  
Some units may partially bury or become encased in dust accumulation, losing functionality.

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Low  
**Risk Category:** Performance

**Mitigation:**
- Accept this as normal
- Move or abandon unit
- Rely on redundancy
- Avoid placing in extreme drift zones unless intentional

**Residual Risk:**  
Low. Benign failure.

---

### R6 — Becoming a Policy Problem

**Description:**  
Worst case is not technical failure.  
Worst case is bureaucracy:

- committees
- review boards
- incident reporting cycles
- documentation churn
- inter-department power friction

**Likelihood:** Low to Medium  
**Impact:** High  
**Risk Category:** Infrastructure / Organizational

**Mitigation:**
- Clear early ownership assignment
- Simple rules, minimal governance
- Explicit right to discard without escalation
- Intentional design as “boring infrastructure”

**Residual Risk:**  
Depends entirely on mission culture.
Technically avoidable, politically variable.

---

### R7 — Misplacement Reducing Effectiveness

**Description:**  
DCF positioned in locations that produce minimal capture benefit, reducing program value.

**Likelihood:** High  
**Impact:** Low  
**Risk Category:** Performance

**Mitigation:**
- Corridor / perimeter framing
- Living deployment model (move occasionally)
- Accept uneven yield as normal
- Scaling via quantity rather than precision

**Residual Risk:**  
Low impact; annoyance only.

---

### R8 — Crew Friction or Resistance

**Description:**  
Crew may resent non-critical infrastructure or see it as pointless.

**Likelihood:** Medium  
**Impact:** Medium  
**Risk Category:** Operational Culture

**Mitigation:**
- Keep interaction near-zero
- Make removal trivial
- Make presence non-intrusive
- Allow crews to decide placement improvements

**Residual Risk:**  
Low when footprint and interference remain small.

---

## What Risks Are Explicitly NOT Present

DCF does **not** introduce:
- catastrophic mission threat risk
- systemic single-point-of-failure risk
- acute human safety risk when deployed intelligently
- power dependency risk
- network / software failure risk
- hardware fragility risk

DCF’s worst realistic outcomes are annoyance, clutter, or irrelevance.
That is intentional.

---

## Risk Handling Doctrine

If a DCF unit:
- creates friction
- creates argument
- creates administrative work
- creates emotional weight

then the correct mitigation is:

> remove it, discard it, move on

No guilt.
No debate.
No sunk-cost fallacy.

The system is only valuable so long as it remains boring.

---

## Phase 2 Success Criteria (Risk Contribution)

This document succeeds if:

- leadership understands risks without feeling alarmed
- none of the risks feel hidden or hand-waved
- mitigations feel realistic rather than corporate theater
- planners trust that failure states are safe and quiet

If decision-makers finish reading and think:

> “There are risks, they’re honest, and none of them threaten the mission,”

then Phase 2 risk framing has done its job.
